## **Overview**



ColorBlindSimulator is a Python-based project that simulates how images appear to individuals with color vision deficiencies (Protanopia, Deuteranopia, and Tritanopia) and optimizes images to improve visibility for affected users. It uses PIL, NumPy, and Matplotlib to process and display images.

## **Features**

Simulates three types of color blindness: Protanopia (red deficiency), Deuteranopia (green deficiency), and Tritanopia (blue deficiency).

Optimizes images by enhancing specific color channels for better perception.

Displays results in a 3x2 grid layout with clear titles.

Saves processed images for further use.

## **Prerequisites**
To run this project, you need:
- **Python 3.6** or higher
- Required libraries:
  - **Pillow** (*PIL*) for image processing
  - **NumPy** for matrix operations
  - **Matplotlib** for visualization
- An input image in a supported format (*e.g.*, JPG, PNG)
Matplotlib for visualization
